<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p>Use of this software will most probably invalidate your console
warranty, proceed with installation at your own risk. The software
installs in an unused portion of the flash chip on the wifi module but
is still what Nintendo term an unauthorised modification.</p></div>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>dslink is a simple and effective method to transfer homebrew games
and applications to your DS(i) over wifi. Simply run dslink.nds on your
DS console, wait for it to connect and use the command line dslink host
tool to send an nds file.
</p><pre>	dslink [-a ip address] &lt;ndsfile&gt;
</pre>
<p>
</p><p>The dslink host uses UDP broadcast messages to discover your DS
but this won't work for some people due to routers either not passing on
 these packets or sending them at a speed the DS can't read. If you get
"No Response from DS!" then try specifiying the ip address of your DS
with the -a switch.</p>
<h3>DSi mode</h3>
<p>Here's the part most people will probably be interested in, homebrew running in DSi mode.</p>
<p>While playing around with the <a href="">save game exploits</a> for Cooking Coach
 and Classic Word Games I created back in 2010 I discovered two things
 about the flashchip on the wifi module where the firmware would be stored
 on a normal DS. (1) It contains only the setup data for wifi, the user settings
 and the wifi connection settings and, (2) Part of it is writable, from DS mode. This
was what finally gave me the motivation to revisit an old project to
upload homebrew to the DS over wifi.</p>
<p>installDSiLink.nds will, when run from a DSi compatible card in DS
mode, write the dslink client to the wifi flash chip and this can then
be bootstrapped from the save game exploits mentioned above. You'll need
 to write the appropriate .SAV file from this archive to your game of
choice from either a DS with <a href="http://blog.davr.org/2007/03/31/eepinator/">eepinator</a>
 or use one of the save game transfer devices around. Cooking Coach is
more convenient since the exploit kicks in just after the splash screen,
 with Classic Word Games you need to go through a couple of menu
options.</p>
<p>Unfortunately testing revealed that later model DSi and XL consoles
have had changes made to the wifi board which means that writing to the
 firmware flash chip is no longer possible. You'll know if you have one
of these consoles if either the installer fails to write the loader or
the loader fails to connect when bootstrapped. Sorry if you have one of
these consoles, you'll have to wait a little bit longer to play with DSi
 mode.</p>
<p>In March 2012 Nintendo released firmware version 1.4.4 which checks for these
exploits and writes a 0 to the end of the string before launching the games.
<p>At the end of 2014 we found another exploitable DSi hybrid game - The Biggest Loser USA
and this archive now contains save file exploits for the EU and US versions. This time
I haven't made this exploit code public - last time Cooking Coach was used
to create a piracy device.</p>
<p>libnds still needs some more updates to deal with DSi mode features,
currently the swi decompression functions seem to have changed and we
have no microphone input. Hopefully now there's a reasonably
straightforward way to run code we can get a few more people looking at
what we need to change and how best to approach it.</p>
